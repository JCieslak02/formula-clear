# Formula-clear

Formula-clear is an application designed for Formula 1 fans. It serves as a one-stop-shop for all F1-related statistics, utilizing [Ergast's](http://ergast.com/mrd/) database for F1 data, which has been modified to cater to my needs, and the [Open-meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs/historical-weather-api) to retrieve weather conditions for each event. 

The application's primary focus is on special events such as finishers, safety cars, and red flags, with more features to be developed over time.
